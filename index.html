  <h2>Early Years</h2>
  <h3>Hometown</h3>
  <p>Charleston, South Carolina</p>
  <h3>Birthday</h3>
  <p>May 7, 1998</p>
  <h3>High School Extracurriculars</h3>
  <p>While in high school, my interest in art really began to flourish. Before my freshman year, I had particpated in a
    music camp where we created a band and had a showcase in the end. We got to create our own band tshirts and
    experiment with many different instruments. My main questions was, "What will we wear?"
    I created the design for our band, Sternum, t-shirt which we all got to screenprint together. It was alot of fun and
    after that I would make sketches all the time. My favorite show was Project Runway and I would make my own sketches
    based on the contestant's weekly challenges.
    I also gained an interest in business and was able to get on the Executive Board of DECA, the school's
    entrprenuership and business organization. I'm glad that I aprticipated in this as I got a great scholarship in
    college for being a part of it. </p>
  <h2>College Years</h2>
  <p>When I was deciding where I would go to college, I had two questions:
  <ol>
    <li>Is Fashion Merchandising offered as a Major?</li>
    <li>Do they have great study abroad programs?</li>
  </ol>
  My friends and some family members were not happy about my short checklist for a college. They said things like "You
  don't care about the sports/party life/sororities??" or "Maybe you should try someothing less specific."
  I didn't let that stop me and chose a small school in a nice city just 3 hours away from my hometown: Johnson and
  Wales Unviversity in Charlotte, NC. I learned alot during this time both in and outside of the classroom.

          <p>During my freshman year of college, I won 2nd Place in our school's business pitch competition. Hatima was
            a monthly subscription based service that would promote small black owned beauty/skin care businesses.This
            program was a great look into what entrprenuership is and I was honored to be apart of it.</p>

          <h5>London Study Abroad</h5>
          <p>During my second study abroad experience, I visited London, England. I had the awesome oppurtunity to
            intern during London Fashion Week which was so much fun and eye-opening. I was able to see all that goes
            into a successful fashion show. I really enjoyed being a part of it and know that one day instead of a staff
            member, I will be a guest at fashion shows.</p>

          <p>I finished my senior year 1 semester early in Winter 2019, but my school didn't have a separate Winter and
            Spring ceremonies. Unfortunately, I was unable to walk across the stage due to Covid 19 Restrictions in May
            2020. My mom and I visited a beautiful park and she took this pic of me with my diploma to celebrate my
            accomplishment.</p>

  <h2>Post Undergraduate Life and Career Goals</h2>
  <h3>Present Day</h3>
  <p>Currently, I work as a remote customer service representative for Coach, the luxury leather goods company. It can
    be very challenging because I am dealing with complaints from
    disgruntled people. This job has taught me alot about professionalism and conflict resolution. Before making the
    leap into tech I thought that I would be a Fashion Buyer, but after completing an internship in the field I decided
    that it wasn't the right career for me.
    I see my customer service job as a stepping stone towards my future career and not the final destination. I work
    10hrs/4days a week so I am able to have 3 whole days to focus on the UX Design bootcamp I'm participating in and my
    Web Design Master's degree program. I believe in hard work and know that it will pay off in the future. I manage my
    time wisely because it is my most valuable asset right now. </p>

  <h3>Future Plans</h3>
  <p>By the beginning of Summer 2023, my UX Design Bootcamp will be over. Gratefully, this program has Career Services
    so they will assist me with my LinkedIn profile, resume, and job search. By the end of Summer 23, I will have my
    first UX Design or UX Research role. From there, I will gain more coding/front end development skills and perfect my
    portfolio so that I can get my first job as a front end web developer.
    Ultimately, I want to work for a great company as a Senior Front End Web Developer. I see myself as a future leader
    and know that I can make my mark on the tech industry.
